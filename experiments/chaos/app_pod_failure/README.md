## Experiment Metadata

| Type  | Description              | Storage | Applications  | K8s Platform |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Chaos | Fail the application pod | OpenEBS | Percona MySQL | Any          |

## Entry-Criteria

- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- Application writes are successful 

## Exit-Criteria

- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- Data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read
- Database consistency is maintained as per db integrity check utils
- Storage target pods are healthy

## Notes

- Typically used as a disruptive test, to cause loss of access to storage by failing the application pod.
- Tests Recovery workflow of the application pod.

## Associated Utils 

- `pod_failure_by_sigkill.yaml`

## Litmusbook Environment Variables

### Application

| Parameter     | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| APP_NAMESPACE | Namespace in which application pods are deployed             |
| APP_LABEL     | Unique Labels in `key=value` format of application deployment |

### Health Checks 

| Parameter              | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LIVENESS_APP_NAMESPACE | Namespace in which external liveness pods are deployed, if any |
| LIVENESS_APP_LABEL     | Unique Labels in `key=value` format for external liveness pod, if any |
| DATA_PERSISTENCE       | Specify the application name against which data consistency has to be ensured. Example: busybox,mysql |


## Procedure

This experiment kills the application container and verifies if the container is scheduled back and the data is intact. Based on CRI used, uses the relevant util to kill the application container.

After injecting the chaos into the component specified via environmental variable, e2e experiment observes the behaviour of corresponding OpenEBS PV and the application which consumes the volume.

### Data consistency check

Based on the value of env DATA_PERSISTENCE, the corresponding data consistency util will be executed. At present only busybox and percona-mysql are supported. Along with specifying env in the e2e experiment, user needs to pass name for configmap and the data consistency specific parameters required via configmap in the format as follows:

    parameters.yml: |
      blocksize: 4k
      blockcount: 1024
      testfile: difiletest
It is recommended to pass test-name for configmap and mount the corresponding configmap as volume in the e2e pod. The above snippet holds the parameters required for validation data consistency in busybox application.

For percona-mysql, the following parameters are to be injected into configmap.

    parameters.yml: |
      dbuser: root
      dbpassword: k8sDem0
      dbname: tdb
The configmap data will be utilised by e2e experiments as its variables while executing the scenario.

Based on the data provided, e2e checks if the data is consistent after recovering from induced chaos.
