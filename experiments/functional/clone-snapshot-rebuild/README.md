| Type       | Description                                                 | Storage | Applications | K8s Platform |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Functional | Attempting  clone creation under snapshot rebuild scenarios | OpenEBS | Busybox      | Any          |

## Entry-Criteria

- K8s nodes should be ready.
- Application should be deployed successfully consuming OpenEBS storage.

## Exit-Criteria

- Cloned volume should be created successfully post snapshot rebuild process.
- The cloned volume should contain data available during snapshot creation.

## Notes

- This functional test checks if the Cloned volume can be created successfully using volume snapshot post rebuild.
- The e2ebook receives necessary parameters inf the form of environmental variables.
