## Experiment Metadata

| Type       | Description                   | Storage | Applications | K8s Platform |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Functional | Scaling jiva storage replicas | OpenEBS | Cassandra    | Any          |

## Entry-Criteria

- K8s nodes should be ready.
- Application should be deployed successfully consuming OpenEBS storage.

## Exit-Criteria

- Jiva replicas should be scaled after updating replication factor in its corresponding deployment.
- The number of ready_replicas should match the desired count.
- The storage target should be created and be accessible.

## Notes

- This functional test checks if the jiva storage replica can be scaled.
- The e2ebook accepts parameters in the form of environmental variables.

## Associated Utils
