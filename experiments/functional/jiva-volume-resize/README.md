## Experiment Metadata

| Type       | Description                                                  | Storage | Applications | K8s Platform |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Functional | Increase the storage capacity of jiva volumes. | OpenEBS | Any          | Any          |

## Entry-Criteria

- K8s nodes should be ready.
- K8s nodes should have ubuntu 18.04 installed.
- Application should be deployed using 'jiva storage engine'.

## Exit-Criteria

- Volume should be resized successfully and application should be accessible seamlessly.
- Application should be able to use the new space.

## Notes

- This functional test checks if the Jiva volume can be resized.
- This e2ebook accepts the parameters in form of job environmental variables.
- This job updates the storage capacity of volume, you can verify the same by ssh into corresponding node on which application is deployed and use `lsblk`.
- After the volume expansion, size will not be reflected on `kubectl get pv` for the corresponding volume.
- It checks if the application is accessible and the corresponding file system is scaled up.
