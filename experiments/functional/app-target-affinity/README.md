## Experiment Metadata

| Type       | Description                                                  | Storage | Applications | K8s Platform |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Functional | Ensure application and storage target are scheduled on same node | OpenEBS | Any          | Any          |

## Entry-Criteria

- K8s nodes should be ready.
- Application should be deployed successfully consuming OpenEBS storage.

## Exit-Criteria

- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- The application pod and its corresponding storage target pod should be scheduled on the same no

## Notes

- This functional test checks if the application pod instance and its corresponding storage target pod are present in same node.

- This e2ebook can be used to validate both the types of application deployments such as K8s deployment and statefulsets.

- If it is not scheduled on same node, the test is considered to be failed.
