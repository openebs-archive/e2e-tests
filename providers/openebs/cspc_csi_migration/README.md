## Test Case to Migrate the spc non-csi components into cspc csi components

## Description
   - This test case is capable of Migrating the OpenEBS SPC pool and cStor volume components into CSPC pool and CSI volume
   - Before migrating the pool we have to provision the cStor opertor. 
   - This test constitutes the below files.
     - cstor-volume-migration-job.j2 - Volume migration job template which has to be populated with the given variables.
     - cstor-spc-migration-job.j2 - Pool migration job template which has to be populated with the given variables.
     - test_vars.yml - This test_vars file has the list of test specific variables used in LitmusBook.
     - test.yml - Playbook where the test logic is built to migrate the CSPC CSI components.
     - cstor_pool_migration.yml - This file includes the task to Migrate the SPC pools into CSPC pool
     - cstor_volume_migration - This file includes the task to Migrate the non csi volumes into csi volume
   - This test case should be provided with the parameters in form of job environmental variables in run_litmus_test.yml
